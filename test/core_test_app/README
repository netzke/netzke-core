== Netzke-core testing application

This application is used as a helper app by the RSpec tests run from the root of the plugin, but can also be run stand-alone (don't forget to link extjs into public, and run the migrations).

After you start the server, you can access any component from lib/netzke using the following URL schema:

http://localhost:3000/components/<full_component_class_name>, e.g.:

http://localhost:3000/components/ServerCaller

or

http://localhost:3000/components/ScopedComponents::SomeScopedComponent

etc
