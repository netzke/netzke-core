module Netzke
  # == JavaScript class generation
  #
  # (For class-level DSL methods mentioned here see {ClassMethods})
  #
  # Each component operates on both client and server side. At the server side it's represented (naturally) by a Ruby class, at the client side it's represented by a corresponding JavaScript class. The JavaScript class extends the Ext JS class specified by +js_base_class+, or, in case of extending an existing Netzke component, that component's JavaScript class.
  #
  # A component can "mixin" a JavaScript object from a .js file into its class by using the +js_mixin+ +method+.
  #
  # When the component has some extra JavaScript code as dependency, this can be included by using +js_include+ method.
  #
  # Defining JavaScript class-level properties (besides putting them right into a JavaScript mixin) is possible in Ruby by using the +js_property+ and +js_properties+ methods.
  #
  # An example of using these methods:
  #
  #     class MyTabPanel < Netzke::Base
  #       js_base_class "Ext.tab.Panel"
  #       js_mixin :extra_properties # mixin my_component/javascripts/extra_properties.js
  #       js_include :some_javascript_dependency # include my_component/javascripts/some_javascript_dependency.js
  #       js_property :active_tab, 0 # this could also be defined in extra_properties.js
  #       # ...
  #     end
  #
  # == JavaScript class instantiation
  #
  # The JavaScript class gets instantiated with the config object defined by the +js_config+ method as constructor parameter.
  #
  # == JavaScript instance methods
  #
  # The following public JavaScript methods are defined on (mixed-in into) all Netzke components (for detailed documentation on them see the inline documentation in javascript/base.js and javascript/ext.js files):
  # * loadNetzkeComponent - dynamically loads a child Netzke component
  # * instantiateChildNetzkeComponent - instantiates and returns a Netzke component by its item_id
  # * netzkeFeedback - shows a feedback message
  # * componentNotInSession - gets called when the session that the component is defined in gets expired. Override it to do whatever is appropriate.
