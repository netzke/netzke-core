## Component self-configuration

Often when extending an existing component (e.g. from `Netzke::Basepack`), there's a need to tune its behaviour by modifying its configuration. There are 2 methods that can be overridden in order to achieve that: `Base#configure` and `Base#js_configure`. The former is used to configure a component as whole. The latter - exclusively the component's JavaScript class instance. `js_configure` is being called only when the component is being rendered in the browser, and not when a component is instantiated, for example, for invoking its endpoint.

Both methods receive as the only argument a `ActiveSupport::OrderedOptions`, which allows for syntax like this:

    def configure(c)
      c.some_config_option = 42
      c.merge!(option_one: 1, option_two: 2)
      super
    end

Calling `super` is essential for the super-component to do its own configuration (for example, `Netzke::Base#configure` would mix in the passed config options).

The `Base#default_config` method and any other `Base#*_config` methods are gone and should be replaced with `Base#configure` or `Base#js_configure` - depending on the goal.

### Base#configure

The `configure` method must be used to override the configuration of a component as whole (influencing component's both Ruby and JavaScript behaviour). For example, if the super component implements the `persistence` option, we may want to enable it in our component like this:

    def configure(c)
      c.persistence = true
      super
    end

The place to call `super` is important. In the provided example, the `persistence` option can be overridden by this component's user. However, if we put it after `super`, it will override the user's setting. Another example of overriding a user's setting might be, for example, extending a component bottom bar depending on the `mode` config:

    def configure(c)
      super
      c.bbar = [*c.bbar, '-', :admin] if c.mode == :admin
    end

The `configure` method is useful for (dynamically) defining toolbars, titles, and other properties of a component's instance.

### Access to component's config

The result of `Base#configure` can be accessed through `Base#config` method from anywhere in the class.

### Base#js_configure

The `js_configure' method should be used to override the JS-side component configuration. It is called by the framework when the configuration for the JS instantiating of the component should be retrieved. Thus, it's *not* being called when a component is being instantiated to process an endpoint call. Override it when you need to extend/modify the config for the JS component intance.

The execution of `js_configure` does not influence the content of the `Base#config` method.

## JavaScript class configuration

The following DSL methods are gone: `js_include`, `js_mixin`, `js_base_class`, `js_method`, `js_property`, `js_properties`. Instead, use the `js_configure` class method (not to be confused with the previously mentioned *intstance* method `Base#js_configure`):

    class MyComponent < Netzke::Base
      js_configure do |c|
        c.mixin                     # replaces js_mixin preserving the signature
        c.require                   # replaces js_include preserving the signature
        c.extend = "Ext.tab.Panel"  # replaces js_base_class

        c.title = "My Component"    # use instead of js_property :title, "My Component"

        c.on_my_action = <<-JS      # use instead of js_method :on_my_action, ...
          function(){
            // ...
          }
        JS
      end

      # ...
    end

As you see, assignement must be used to define the JS class's properties, including functions.

## Actions

The `action` DSL method does not accept a hash as an optional second parameter any longer, but rather a block, which receives a configuration object:

    action :destroy do |c|
      c.text = "Destroy!"
      c.tooltip = "Destroying it all"
      c.icon = :delete
    end

The following is still valid:

    action :my_action # it will use default (eventually localized) values for text and tooltip

### Overriding actions in inherited classes

Overriding an action while extending a component is possible by using the same `acton` method. To receive the action config from the superclass, use the `super` method, passing to it the block parameter:

    action :destroy do |c|
      super(c) # do the config from the superclass
      c.text = "Destroy if you dare" # overriding the text
    end

### Referring to actions in toolbars/menus

`Symbol#action` is no longer defined. Refer to actions in toolbars/menus by simply using symbols:

    def configure(c)
      super
      c.bbar = [:my_action, :destroy]
    end

Another way (useful when re-configuring the toolbars of a child component) is by using hashes that have the `netzke_action` key:

    def configure(c)
      super

      c.bbar = [
        { netzke_action: :my_action, title: "My cool action" },
        { netzke_action: :destroy, title: "Destroy!" }
      ]
    end

Referring to actions on the class level (e.g. with `js_property :bbar`) will no longer work. Define the toolbars inside the `configure` method.

### I18n of actions

+text+, +tooltip+ and +icon+ for an action will be picked up from a locale file (if located there) whenever they are not specified in the config.
E.g., an action `some_action` defined in the component +MyComponents::CoolComponent+, will look for its text in:

    I18n.t('my_components.cool_component.actions.some_action.text')

for its tooltip in:

    I18n.t('my_components.cool_component.actions.some_action.tooltip')

and for its icon in:

    I18n.t('my_components.cool_component.actions.some_action.icon')

## Child components

### Defining child components

A child component gets defined with the `component` method receiving a block:

    component :east_center_panel do |c|
      c.klass = SimpleComponent
      c.title = "A panel"
      c.border = false
    end

Child component's class is now specified as the `klass` option and is actually a Class, not a String. When no `klass` or no block is given, the component's class will be derived from its name, e.g.:

    component :simple_component

is equivalent to:

    component :simple_component do |c|
      c.klass = SimpleComponent
    end

Defining a component in a block gives an advantage of accessing the `config` method of the parent component, e.g.:

    component :east_center_panel do |c|
      c.klass = SimpleComponent
      c.title = config.east_center_panel_title # something that could be passed as a config option to the parent component
    end

If no `klass` is specified, `Netzke::Core::Panel` is assumed.

### Overriding child components

Overriding a child component while extending a component is possible by using the same `component` method. To receive the child component config from the superclass, use the `super` method, passing to it the block parameter:

    component :simple_component do |c|
      super(c) # do the config from the superclass
      c.klass = LessSimpleComponent # use a different class
    end

### Lazy vs eager component loading

All child components now by default are being lazily loaded on request from the parent, unless they are referred in the layout (see the **Layout** section). You can override this behavior by setting `eager_loading` to `true`, so that the child component's config and class are instantly available at the parent.

## Layout

### Referring to Netzke components

The `Symbol#component` method is no longer defined. The preferred way of referring to child components in (docked) items is by using symbols:

    # provided child_one and child_two components are defined in the class
    def configure(c)
      super

      c.items = [:child_one, :child_two]
    end

Another way (useful when re-configuring the layout of a child component) is by using hashes that have the `component` key:

    def configure(c)
      super

      c.items = [
        { xtype: :panel, title: "Simple Ext panel" },
        { component: :child_one, title: "First child" },
        { component: :child_two, title: "Second child" }
      ]
    end

### Implicitly defined components in items

Previously there was a way to specify a component class directly in items (by using the `class_name` option), which would implicitly define a child component. This is no longer possible. The layout can now only refer to explicitly defined components.

### Specifying items in config

It is possible to specify the items in the config in the same format as it is done in the `items` method. If `config.items` is provided, it takes precedence over the `items` method. This can be useful for modifying the default layout of a child component by means of configuring it.

It's advised to override the `items` method when a component needs to define it's layout, and not use the `configure` method for that (see the **Self-configuration** section).

### DSL-delegated methods are gone

No more `title` and `items` are defined as DSL methods. Include `Netzke::ConfigToDslDelegator` and use `delegate_to_dsl` method if you need that functionality in a component.
Thus, `Netzke::ConfigToDslDelegator` is not included in Netzke::Base anymore.

## Defining client class

Client class (JavaScript part of the component) has been refactored.

### Methods renamed

The following public method name changes took place for the sake of consistence:

* localId => netzkeLocalId
* setResult => netzkeSetResult
* endpointUrl => netzkeEndpointUrl
* loadNetzkeComponent => netzkeLoadComponent (signature changed, see "javascripts/ext.js")
* componentDelivered => netzkeComponentDelivered
* componentDeliveryFailed => netzkeComponentDeliveryFailed
* getParentNetzkeComponent => netzkeGetParentComponent
* reload => netzkeReload
* instantiateChildNetzkeComponent => netzkeInstantiateComponent
* getChildNetzkeComponent => netzkeGetComponent

  * Make some of `Netzke::Core` setup happen earlier in the loading process, so that we can safely use it while defining components.
  * Performance improvements by memoizing `Base.constantize_class_name`.
  * I18n for actions, see `Netzke::Actions`.

* bug fix
  * The "componentload" event now gets fired after a component is dynamically loaded. The handler receives the instance of the loaded component.

* Ext 3.2.1
* Fix: Netzke::Base.before_load is now also called for the widgets embedded directly into a view.
* New: support for external stylesheets.
* Fix: the "value" column type has been changed to text to prevent migration problems is some cases
* New: global_persistent_config method allows accessing persistent storage with no owner (widget) assigned
* New: any widget can now implement <tt>before_api_call</tt> interceptor. If it returns anything but empty hash, it'll be used as the result of *any* API call to this widget. The interceptor receives as parameter the name of the API call issued and the arguments. Use it to implement authorization.
* Fix: got the Ext's state provider out of the way (thank you for all the confusion)

# v0.5.1 - 2010-02-26
* Compatibility with Ext 3.1.1
* New: <tt>Netzke.page</tt> object now contains all the widgets declared on the page
* Code: replaced (references to) deprecated function names

# v0.5.0 - 2010-01-10
* Compatibility with Ext 3.1.0
* API change: Netzke widget's now should be declared directly in the views instead of controllers.
* API change: all ExtJS and Netzke JavaScript and styles are now loaded with the help of <tt>netzke_init</tt> helper.
* API change: <tt>persistence_key</tt> option replaces <tt>persistent_config_id</tt> option.
* Impr: headers in panels in the "config" mode now show the widget's global ID.
* New: required ExtJS version check introduced at initial Netzke load.
* Depr: :widget_class_name option is deprecated, use :class_name.
* DRY: now there's no need to always define "actions" method, use it to override the defaults, which are automatically calculated based on configuration for toolbars/menu.
* Impr: each generated JS class now has its unique xtype, e.g. "netzkegridpanel".
* Fix: FeedbackGhost moved over from netzke-basepack.

# v0.4.5.2 - 2009-11-09
* Fix: Hash#convert_keys and Array#convert_keys in core extensions are now renamed into deep_convert_keys, and now always plainly do what they're expected to do: recursively convert keys according to given block.

# v0.4.5.1 - 2009-11-09
* Regression: fixing inheritance and caching.
* FeedbackGhost is too simple to be a Netzke widget (having no server part), so, moved to static JavaScript.

# v0.4.5 - 2009-11-08
* API change: Netzke::Base: <tt>id_name</tt> accessor renamed to <tt>global_id</tt>
* Code: several internal code changes
* Code: lightly better test coverage
* New: <tt>Netzke::Base#global_id_by_reference</tt> method
* Compatibility: resolving conflicts with the <tt>api</tt> property in some Ext v3.0 components
* Fix: <tt>deliver_component</tt> was throwing exception when the requested component wasn't defined
* New: <tt>persistent_config_id</tt> configuration option allows specifying an id by which persistent configuration is identified for the widget. Handy if different homogeneous widgets need to share the same persistent configuration.
* New: <tt>Netzke::Base#persistent_config</tt> method now accepts an optional boolean parameter signalizing that the configuration is global (not bound to a widget)
* Impr: cleaner handling of actions and toolbars; fbar configuration introduced.
* Impr: calling an API method now provides for the result value (if return by the server) in the callback.
* Impr: allows name spaced creation of Netzke widgets, e.g. widgets can now be defined under any module under Netzke, not only *directly* under Netzke.
* New: support for Ext.Window-based widgets (it'll call show() on them when the "*_widget_render" helper is used).

# v0.4.4 - 2009-10-12
* API change: default handlers for actions and tools are now supposed to be prefixed with "on". E.g.: if you declare an action named <tt>clear_table</tt>, the handler must be called (in Ruby) <tt>on_clear_table</tt> (mapped to <tt>onClearTable</tt> in JavaScript).
* Internal: the JavaScript instance now knows if persistent config is enabled (by checking this.persistentConfig).
* Fix: solving the "Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy" problem by being more strict with duplicated IDs for elements on the same page.
* Fix: Ext 3.0 compatibility.
* Impr: <tt>getChildComponent</tt> now allows referring to a widget like this: "parent__parent__some_widget__some_nested_widget"

# v0.4.3
* Fix: reworking loadComponent()-related code, closing a security flaw when a malicious browser could send any configuration options to instantiate the widget being loaded.

# v0.4.2 - 2009-09-11
* Fix: the API call (at the JavaScript side) was ignoring the callback parameter.
* Impr: if the array of API points is empty, it's not added into js_config anymore.
* New: new testing widgets in netzke_controller.
* Fix: extra CSS includes now take effect.
* New: Support for masquerading as "World". In this mode all the "touched" persistent preferences will be overwritten for all roles and users.
